# Project: Build Hardware Adaptable Model Representations and Compilers

## 0. Overview

The proliferation of specialized hardware accelerators (GPUs, TPUs, FPGAs, ASICs) for machine learning has created a fragmented ecosystem. Deploying a single ML model across this diverse hardware landscape is a significant challenge, often requiring manual, hardware-specific optimizations that are time-consuming and not portable.

This project aims to address this "model deployment problem" by developing **hardware-adaptable model representations and compilers**. The core idea is to create a unified framework where a high-level model can be automatically and efficiently compiled to run on a wide variety of hardware targets. This will enable performance portability, allowing developers to design models without being constrained by the specifics of the underlying hardware, and to deploy them seamlessly on the best-suited processor.

## 1. Key Areas

### 1.1. Model Intermediate Representation (IR)

We will design or extend a flexible Intermediate Representation (IR) for machine learning models. This IR will serve as a "lingua franca" between high-level model descriptions and low-level hardware code.

*   **Multi-Level Abstraction**: The IR must be capable of representing computations at multiple levels, from high-level neural network operators (e.g., convolution, attention) down to low-level, hardware-agnostic linear algebra and memory operations.
*   **Extensibility**: The IR should be easily extensible to support new, innovative model architectures and hardware primitives.
*   **Hardware-Agnosticism**: The core representation will be hardware-agnostic, with mechanisms to progressively lower and incorporate hardware-specific information during the compilation process.

### 1.2. Hardware-Adaptable Compiler

The compiler is the central component that translates the IR into high-performance, executable code for a specific hardware backend.

*   **Modular Backend Design**: The compiler will feature a modular architecture, allowing new hardware backends to be plugged in with minimal effort.
*   **Automated Optimization**: We will implement a suite of automated optimization techniques, including operator fusion, memory layout optimization, parallelization, and target-aware instruction scheduling.
*   **Search-Based Tuning**: To achieve optimal performance, the compiler will incorporate auto-tuning mechanisms (e.g., search-based scheduling) to explore the vast optimization space and discover the best configuration for a given model and hardware target.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

*   **Define a Flexible IR**: To design and implement an extensible, multi-level IR for representing modern ML models.
*   **Develop a Modular Compiler**: To build a compiler framework that can be easily extended to support new hardware backends (e.g., CPUs, GPUs, and custom accelerators).
*   **Achieve Performance Portability**: To demonstrate that models compiled through our framework achieve high performance across a diverse set of hardware targets without manual tuning for each one.
*   **Simplify ML Deployment**: To create a streamlined workflow that simplifies the path from model training to efficient inference deployment on heterogeneous hardware.

## 3. Potential Technologies

This project will draw inspiration from and potentially build upon state-of-the-art technologies in the compiler and ML systems space, including:

*   **MLIR (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation)**: A powerful and extensible compiler infrastructure from the LLVM project, designed specifically for this type of problem.
*   **Apache TVM**: A leading open-source, end-to-end deep learning compiler stack that provides a reference for many of the concepts in this project.
*   **LLVM**: The foundational compiler backend for generating optimized machine code for CPUs and GPUs.
*   **ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)**: As a potential high-level input format for models.
